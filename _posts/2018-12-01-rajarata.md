IEEE Student Branch of Rajarata University of Sri Lanka held its first Annual General Meeting on 30th October 2018 in the university auditorium with the presence of the branch members, academic staff as well as non-IEEE members who are under IT and related disciplines and interested in getting to know more about the new-born union in the campus. 

The main intent of the meeting was electing the executive committee members. Nevertheless, an equally important purpose was to discuss about future arrangements and what the members are looking forward to achieving as a student branch. It was especially made clear to the participants what being part of the organization as a student member can mean to them as future professionals in IT, computer science and related industries, and in turn, the experiences they can gain engaging in various activities as a unit inside the university while they are undergraduates.

The session was winded up with lofty hopes for the times to come, and anticipations of the branch growing as a community and also contributing to enrich other communities in various ways both inside and outside the university by being a leading representation of it.
