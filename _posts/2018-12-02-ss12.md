IEEE SS12 International Project Competition and Maker Fair 2018 was organized by IEEE Sri Lanka Section and IEEE Education Society Madras Section. 

The final event of this competition was held on September 8th and 9th, 2018 at the NSBM Green University, Sri Lanka with the participation of 300+ local and international competitors, 50+ invitees including eminent IEEE leaders, 100+ visitors, and 60+ dedicated volunteers. Undergraduates and school students from nine different countries in the Asia and Africa regions competed under four tracks for two days - Innovation Challenge, Maker Fair, Junior Einstein Competition and Virtual Track.

The four tracks were placed to capture different ideas to address social issues through social innovations. The theme 'EMPATHY TO ENGINEERING: SOLUTIONS FOR MACRO ISSUES' catered for a wide array of fields. This, in turn, addressed issues in line with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, such as poverty and famine, disaster management and first aid, special needs, women safety, healthcare, Illiteracy, sustainable and clean energy and smart cities - to name a few. This was the main reasons for the IEEE Humanitarian Activities Committee (HAC) being the Platinum sponsor of IEEE SS12 2018 as the whole competition was in line with the goals and vision of IEEE HAC.
