The cardinal event organized by the IEEE Student Branch, Women in Engineering Affinity Group and IEEE Computer Society Chapter of Informatics Institute of Technology, CodeSprint 3.0 - Powered by Ideamart, amassed over 150 applications from top Tech universities and institutes in Sri Lanka. Beginning on February 17th this year, the event ran for one month, ending it's journey on the 17th of March 2018. 

What was initially a 24-Hour hackathon, has grown this year to be a Startup Battle. CodeSprintâ€™s goal was to inculcate a spark of ambition in the budding entrepreneurs; that wish to begin their entrepreneurial journey from the University. 

It was held in three phases; starting off with an Idea pitch, where teams showcased their unique solutions. 
In the next phase, accepted applicants gained experience through sessions conducted by industry professionals, passing on their valuable insights on entrepreneurship. 
Afterward, teams had two weeks to build their MVP for the Product pitch on the 10th of March 2018.
Teams were given mentors in respective fields of their products, assisting them is preparation for the final phase, the Investor Pitch, where the final 6 teams were given the lifetime opportunity to pitch their product to angel investors.
