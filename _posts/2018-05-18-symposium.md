Since April of 2014, CRSGI, funded by the United States State Departmentâ€™s Bureau of
Educational and Cultural Affairs through the Global Innovation Institute (GII) has grown into a true global organization that promotes global research related to smart grids. The research framework includes 1) research tool development, 2) research scholar and student mobility, 3) engagement with stakeholders, and 4) knowledge exchange related smart grids applications. The past symposiums and workshops were held in United Sates, Brazil, UK, and India, sharing research tools, survey tools, tutorials related energy management practice, etc. among member universities. The membership, starting form 3 universities from UK, Brazil, and UK, has expanded to include universities from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and China.
Starting from the 7 th Symposium, CRSGI members are ready to initiate smart grid pilot projects and moving into the natural extension of the smart grids, the EV infrastructures. As wealthy countries are attempting to integrate larger EVs, transitional countries are interested in integrating smaller vehicles like electric taxis, e-scooters and e-bikes but in large numbers. University, industry, and community partnerships can make this global interest sustainable reality. CRSGI employs its Research, Development, Demonstration, and Deployment model to develop projects with immediate impact in the society with measurable outcomes. The symposium brought international academic leaders, industry pioneers, and financial experts together to initiate projects from university based hubs.
