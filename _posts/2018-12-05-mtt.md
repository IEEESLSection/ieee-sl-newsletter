IEEE MTT-S (Microwave Theory & Techniques Society) Student Branch Chapter, University of Peradeniya has organized a variety of events including projects, workshops, competitions, and field visits to expose undergraduates to the microwave world.
Recently a Talk Series was organized by the society successfully. The first talk was on ‘Non-Resonating Modes’ and it was conducted by Dr Simone Bastioli, a Distinguish Microwave Lecturer and also the Vice Chair of IEEE MTT-S Filters & Passive Components Technical Committee. Here the participants were able to grab the knowledge about benefits of non-resonating modes, importance of microwave filters, various filter technologies, dielectric resonators based architecture and many more.
The second talk organized was about "Automotive Radar" and it was conducted by Dr Markus Gardill, a Distinguish Microwave Lecturer and a development site engineer at "Hella", Lippstadt, North Rhine-Westphalia. The event was proceeded with sharing the knowledge on automotive megatrends, automotive sensor technology & the radar, operating principles and advanced signal processing.
The society hopes to organize many more productive events and lead the journey of Microwave Engineering for the well-being of young generation.
